# m68000
Repository for TomHarte-style JSON tests for the Motorola 68000. Generated using the microcoded core in MAME. EXPERIMENTAL! They still need refining!

Use decode.py to convert from .json.bin to .json.

They are in the same format as the TomHarte tests, just generated with a better emulator.

NOTE: this is EXPERIMENTAL there may be errors or unforseen issues!
